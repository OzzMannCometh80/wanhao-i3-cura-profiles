### Exported profiles

**NOTE** Broken profiles. Kept for posterity.

These profiles were exported from Wanhao's fork of cura. I wanted to upgrade
Cura and not use some unmaintained fork. Problem with these is that they aren't
really working. When attempting to import these profiles cura seems to just
ignore them, or only use certain changes.
