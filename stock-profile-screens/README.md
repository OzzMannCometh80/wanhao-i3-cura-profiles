## Screenshots of stock wanhao cura printer profile settings

Wanhao maintains their own fork of Cura, but its not kept up to date with Cura
development. Since the new cura profile system in my opinion is a step back I
resorted to screencap all the settings used in Wanhao's fork since I've had
middling success exporting and importing profiles between Cura versions.

I took screenshots of the draft and fine quality profiles.
